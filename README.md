# Give Human a Credit

The main idea of this project is to develop a software / tool, so that immigrants not yet able to apply for jobs can still earn some credits for their work.

**Important note: The project has been halted due to a very similar project going on in China. The [Social Credit System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System) isn't what I'd describe as a progressive integration into society. The main issue might be that the power isn't decentralized but rather focussed on indivuals which themselves might not have the best intentions.**

"Work" is defined as "performing a task". A task can be something like 

* Helping out in the kitchen
* Go buy groceries for the community / camp
* Teach others what they learned
* Host sport activities
* Host a chess club session
* etc

In general you get one token per hour - where a task shouldn't take longer. If the event takes 2 hours you get two. 
So this is highly depending on the nature of the task. Buying groceries shouldn't take longer than 1 hour, so you'll still get 1 token even though you might have spent more time on it. 

The tokens have attributes in alignment with the task you've performed. 

## Time and Tokens

A task can be listed with the amount of tokens you will get to do it. In order to make sure the person gets paid in regard to the time it took to complete the task; the equation goes at follows:

received token = amount of tokens assigned to task * standard time / time till completed 

## Technology

There are a few criterias regarding the technological setup:

1. The software has to be open-source
2. Registration should be easy
3. Usage should be easy and self-explanatory
4. The entries should be available publicly and 24/7 (public ledger? = blockchain)
5. It should be hard, nearly impossible to fake entries
